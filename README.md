# Python-Code

It is based on my course final exam question of SDSC6001: Statistical Machine Learning 2.

The size of train set is 313 rows Ã— 56 columns, which is a High-Dimensional Data Analysis with Dummy, Feature Engineering and LightGBM. Also I combined PCA and tried tree method which did not perform better.

The code is stated in the Document "python_code.py". And the training data is stored in document "train.txt".
